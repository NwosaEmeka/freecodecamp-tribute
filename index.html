                    Yar’Adua foray into party politics began as a Lecturer when he became an active member and mobilizer for the defunct
                    Peoples’ Redemption Party (PRP). During the Transition Programme of President Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, Yar’Adua was
                    one of the foundation members of the Peoples’ Front, a political association under the leadership of his elder brother,
                    the late Major-General Shehu Musa Yar’Adua. That association later fused to form the Social Democratic Party (SDP).

                    On 16th and 17th December 2006, Yar'Adua was chosen as the presidential candidate of the ruling PDP for the April 2007
                    election, receiving 3,024 votes from party delegates; his closest rival, Rochas Okorocha, received 372 votes. Shortly
                    after winning the nomination, Yar'Adua chose Good luck Jonathan, governor of Bayelsa State, as his vice-presidential
                    candidate. In the presidential election, held on 21st April 2007, Yar'Adua won with 70% of the vote (24.6 million votes)

                    Saudi Arabia. On 24 February 2010, Yar'Adua returned to Abuja. His state of health was unclear, but there was
                    speculation that he was still on a life support machine. Various political and religious figures in Nigeria had visited
                    him during his illness saying he would make a recovery. Yar'Adua died on 5th May, 2010 at the Aso Rock presidential
                    villa.
